### Testing

Testing in this project can be separated in three different fields: unit tests in the backend, cypress integration tests in frontend and additional utilities such as PropTypes and validators.

#### Quality of testing

The test coverage is not that large and not all use cases are unfortunately tested. Cypress tests however are very powerful so hopefully their quality makes up for some lack of amount. Backend unit tests cover mostly basic use cases for endpoints, but validators thankfully bring extra security for those.
